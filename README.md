# FFT-Implementation
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Algorithm Implementation: Analyzing Signals and Images with Enhanced Efficiency

It is a program that implements the FFT algorithm. The program has been tested with two input images: 1. square256.raw // 256X256 gray scale raw image. 2. car.raw // 256X256 gray scale raw image.

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
